                <h2>Integrity</h2>
				
				<ul>
				<li><b>Review and sign</b> the course Integrity of Scholarship Agreement (this is homework which will be assigned)</li>
				<li>Cheating WILL be taken seriously. It is not fair to honest students to take cheating lightly, nor is it fair to the cheater to let him/her go on thinking that cheating is a reasonable alternative in life. </li>
				</ul>

				<p>The following are not considered cheating: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>Working on programming assignments or homework alone</li>
				<li>Talking over an assignment with one of our course staff (Instructor, TA, Tutor).</li>
				<li>Using internet resources of a generic nature (e.g. googling “hash tables”)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The following are examples of forbidden activities:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>discussing in any form (written or oral) the assignment implementation, pseudo code or approach with another person other than course staff.</li>
				<li>copying material to or from the internet (sites such as Chegg, Course Hero)</li>
				<li>copying source code from the internet (e.g. google “hash tables” and then copy the code from the internet)</li>
				<li>showing your code or homework to someone else other than course staff</li>
				<li>publishing your code or homework on the internet such that it is accessible to others with the notable exception of course staff. (e.g. no public github repositories).</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Review the Integrity of Scholarship Agreement for more details about what is permitted.	<b>WHEN IN DOUBT, ASK US!!!!</b></p>
				<ul>
				<li>To detect instances of academic integrity violations in programming assignments we will use 3rd party software.  We recommend you only include your class lab account ID (not your name or PID) in your submissions.  Including your name and/or PID may disclose that information to the 3rd party.</li>
				<li>Homeworks and projects are not intended to be the grade-makers, but to prepare you for the tests, which are the grade-makers.  Cheating on a homework or project is not only unethical, but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of homework and projects.</li>
				<li>Penalties -- If we become aware of any violations of these rules by a student we are obligated by Academic Senate policy to initiate the actions described in the Policy on Academic Integrity.  Integrity violations may result in a zero for the assignment, a zero for that portion of your grade, or an “F” in the course, among others.</li>
				<li><b>IN THE PAST - WE HAVE HAD STUDENTS FACE ACADEMIC SANCTIONS DUE TO ACADEMIC INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS IN THIS COURSE. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU.</b></li>
